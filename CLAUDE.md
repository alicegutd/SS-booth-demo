# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Structure

This is a minimal project containing a single HTML file that demonstrates a Service AI Suite for customer support interactions.

## Main File

- `service-ai-suite-demo.html` - A standalone HTML demo showcasing an AI-powered customer service chat interface with features like:
  - Multi-scene conversation simulation (6 scenes)
  - Customer identification and profile panels
  - AI insights and analysis tracking
  - Human-in-the-loop approval workflows
  - Auto-play functionality for demonstrations

## Working with this Project

### Viewing the Demo
To view the demo, simply open `service-ai-suite-demo.html` in a web browser:
```bash
open service-ai-suite-demo.html
```

### File Structure
The project is self-contained with no external dependencies:
- All CSS is embedded in `<style>` tags
- All JavaScript is embedded in `<script>` tags
- No build process or package management required

### Key Components
The HTML file contains several key interactive elements:
- Scene navigation controls (Previous/Next/Auto Play)
- Customer information panel with dynamic loading states
- AI insights panel that tracks conversation analysis
- Modal dialogs for human approval workflows
- Animated chat interface with realistic conversation flow

This is a demonstration/prototype file rather than a production application, so modifications should focus on enhancing the demo experience or adding new demonstration scenarios.
